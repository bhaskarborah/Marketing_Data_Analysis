- Define the features and target. Split the data into training set and test set. 
- Run predictive models such as multiple regression to determine the factors for the next campaigns success.
#### Summary of actionable findings to improve advertising campaign success
- Perform EDA(exploratory data analysis) to determine the various factors for the campaignâ€™s success.
- Which products are performing best.
- Which channels are underperforming.
- Predict whether or not a customer will respond to the next campaign.
- Based on the data,  predict if a customer will respond to the next campaign or not.
#### Classify customers into clusters based on their buying behaviors and demographic information
